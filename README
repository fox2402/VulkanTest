Requires GLM, GLFW3 and Vulkan (Duh)

CMake is working, at least windows and the version of arch I was using

Important stuff:
 - You need a graphic card compatible with Vulkan (makes sense right?)
 - you need Vulkan installed and have the libs in your path
 - GLFW3 and GLM are in submodule, pull them before building (might be better if you want things to actually work)
 - It's directly following the tutorial and some things might be different here and there
